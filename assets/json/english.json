I am unable to stand steady, and my mind seems to be whirling. (30) I see adverse omens, O Keshava, and I do not foresee any good from killing my own kinsmen in battle. (31)",

(32) Those for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures, are here arrayed for battle, ready to give up their lives and wealth. (33)",

        "38-39": "With the destruction of the family, the eternal family virtues perish, and when these virtues are lost, vice overtakes the entire family. (38) When vice prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt, and when women become corrupt, O Varshneya, unwanted progeny are born. (39)",
        "40": "This unwanted progeny leads to hell for the family and for those who destroy the family. Their ancestors fall, deprived of the offerings of rice and water. (40)",
        "41": "By these evil deeds of those who destroy the family and create unwanted progeny, the eternal family and societal duties are obliterated. (41)",
        "42": "O Janardana, we have heard that those men whose family duties are destroyed reside in hell indefinitely. (42)",
        "43-44": "Alas! We are ready to commit a great sin by being prepared to kill our kinsmen out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. (43) It would be better if the sons of Dhritarashtra, with weapons in hand, kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield. (44)",

        "14": "O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed. (2.14)",

        "48": "Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna. Perform your duty and abandon all attachment to success or failure. Such evenness of mind is called yoga. (2.48)",
        "49": "O Dhananjaya, keep all abominable activities far distant by devotional service, and in that consciousness surrender unto the Lord. Those who want to enjoy the fruits of their work are misers. (2.49)",
        "50": "A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad actions even in this life. Therefore strive for yoga, which is the art of all work. (2.50)",
        "51": "By thus engaging in devotional service to the Lord, great sages or devotees free themselves from the results of work in the material world. In this way they become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the state beyond all miseries [by going back to Godhead]. (2.51)",
        "52": "When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard. (2.52)",
        "53": "When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas, and when it remains fixed in the trance of self-realization, then you will have attained the divine consciousness. (2.53)",
        "54": "Arjuna said: \nO Krsna, what are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence? How does he speak, and what is his language? How does he sit, and how does he walk? (2.54)",
        "55": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: \nO Partha, when a man gives up all varieties of desire for sense gratification, which arise from mental concoction, and when his mind, thus purified, finds satisfaction in the self alone, then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness. (2.55)",
        "56": "One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called a sage of steady mind. (2.56)",
        "57": "In the material world, one who is unaffected by whatever good or evil he may obtain, neither praising it nor despising it, is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge. (2.57)",
        "58": "One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws its limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge. (2.58)",
        "59": "The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness. (2.59)",
        "60": "The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them. (2.60)",
        "61": "One who restrains his senses and fixes his consciousness upon Me is known as a man of steady intelligence. (2.61)",
        "62": "While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises. (2.62)",
        "63": "From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool. (2.63)",
        "64": "But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his senses through regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord. (2.64)",
        "65": "For one thus satisfied [in Krishna consciousness], the threefold miseries of material existence exist no longer; in such satisfied consciousness, oneâ€™s intelligence is soon well established. (2.65)",
        "66": "One who is not connected with the Supreme [in Krishna consciousness] can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace? (2.66)",
        "67": "As a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a manâ€™s intelligence. (2.67)",
        "68": "Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence. (2.68)",
        "69": "What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage. (2.69)",
        "70": "A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desiresâ€”that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always stillâ€”can alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires. (2.70)",
        "71": "A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false egoâ€”he alone can attain real peace. (2.71)",
        "72": "That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God. (2.72)"
